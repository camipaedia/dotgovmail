 -a "{agency name}" will give a non-/mail-sending, non-/SPF, non-/DMARC breakdown by {agency}. (See all agencies available with -l.) Be sure to wrap {agency} in quotes. When running -a, all other options are run by default (i.e., there is no need to select -m, -s, or -d options with -a).

 -d will check for DMARC records at _dmarc.{domain}.gov for all mail-sending and non-mail sending domains.

 -f will force an update if the mail files are newer than 1 week. This must be the first option.

 -l will show all available federal agencies to select from.

 -s will check for SPF on all mail-sending and non-mail-sending domains.


dotgovmail is intended to operate over organizations, like the federal goverment as a whole or on all domains owned by the Department of the Interior. If you want to get similar results on just a single domain, run the following:

for mail:
$ host -t mx [domain]

for SPF:
$ host -t txt [domain]

for DMARC:
$ host -t txt _dmarc.[domain]"
